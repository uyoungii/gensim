Top Contributors

See the `full list of contributors on Github <https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/graphs/contributors>`_ and I'm thankful to all of them.

Let me also highlight the "main stars" of Gensim here:

- Radim Řehůřek, `piskvorky <https://github.com/piskvorky>`_: Creator of Gensim AKA me. I prefer not to count the late-night hours volunteered on Gensim development & support since 2009.
- Gordon Mohr, `gojomo <https://github.com/gojomo>`_: Core Gensim contributor, key developer of its doc2vec implementation. ‘Oracle Open Source Developer of the Year’ in 2006, creator of the Heritrix web crawler and the ‘magnet link’.
- Misha Penkov, `mpenkov <https://github.com/mpenkov>`_: Core maintainer and release manager of Gensim, Smart_open, SQLitedict, and other open source packages. Lives and works in Sapporo, Japan.
